# DNA Sequence Analysis and Protein Modeling
This Python script provides a set of tools for DNA sequence analysis and 3D protein modeling. It allows users to perform the following tasks:

1. DNA Sequence Analysis:
Input a DNA sequence.
Count the occurrences of adenine (A), thymine (T), guanine (G), and cytosine (C) nucleotides.
Convert the DNA sequence to an RNA sequence.
Translate the DNA sequence to a protein sequence.

2. 3D Protein Modeling:
Generate a 3D protein model from a given DNA or protein sequence.
Utilizes the Swiss-Model API to create predictive 3D protein models.
View the generated protein model in PyMOL.

Prerequisites:

Before running the script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

Python 3.x,
Required Python packages (requests, io, gzip, subprocess),
Pymol 

Usage
1. Run the script using Python:
python3 dna_sequence_analysis.py

2. Follow the menu options to perform DNA sequence analysis and protein modeling tasks.

Notes:
Begin with a valid DNA sequence. 
The script validates input sequences and checks for valid DNA sequences.
